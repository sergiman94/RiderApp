# Rider App

This project is based on a platform about an "uber" clone, this is the rider repository it means this is where the user  
request the "uber", this project is developed in "swift3" programming language and using the Xcode 9 program, This app 
doesn't work without the driver reception, also we are working with a google database system, if you want to create your
own database go to https://firebase.google.com/ the page should tell you step by step how to create your own database 
system with swiftt 3 and Xcode9.

## Getting Started

This project is for Xcode 9, you should have installed Cocoapods, if you haven't installed Cocoapods go to the web page 
https://cocoapods.org/ there is a brief explanation about how to install them.

### Prerequisites

you will need this pods:

    ```
    pod 'Firebase'
    pod 'Firebase/Auth'
    pod 'Firebase/Storage'
    pod 'Firebase/Database'
    pod 'Firebase/Core'
    ```
    
The app is using the Firebase database system in order to save the users and all the data, also the app is using the 
user's/driver's location in order to determine from where is the request, so on the .plist file from the Xcode project you 
should add a row with the next keys asking for the user to allow the app to get the location,the string value is on your 
own:   

    ```
